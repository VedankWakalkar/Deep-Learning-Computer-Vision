Assignments

This Repository contains my data learning and computer vision assignments feel free to add or work on this assignment thankyou.

Assignment 1 Problem Statement : Design and implement a single-layer perceptron to solve a basic binary classification problem. Use the Iris dataset and classify the flowers into one of two classes. Discuss the limitations of the perceptron when dealing with non-linearly separable data.

Assignment 2 Problem Statement : Implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to classify digits from the MNIST dataset. Experiment with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons per layer. Compare the results in terms of accuracy and training time.

Assignment 3 Problem Statement: Investigate how different activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) impact the performance of a neural network. Implement a neural network on a dataset of your choice and compare the results using the different activation functions.

Assignment 4 Problem Statement: Implement the backpropagation algorithm from scratch to train a neural network for a simple regression task. You are not allowed to use high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for this task. Evaluate the network's performance and explain how the gradients are propagated through the network.

Assignment 5 Problem Statement: Explore the effect of regularization techniques (L2 regularization, dropout) on a neural network trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compare the model's performance with and without regularization and discuss how these techniques help in preventing overfitting.

Assignment 6 Problem statement:Design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Experiment with different architectures (number of convolutional layers, filter sizes) and analyze how they influence the network's performance.

Assignment 7 Problem Statement:Use a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet, VGG16) to perform transfer learning on a custom image dataset (e.g., flowers, animals). Fine-tune the model and compare its performance with training a CNN from scratch on the same dataset.

Assignment 8 Problem Statement: Implement an RNN to classify the sentiment of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. Experiment with LSTM and GRU cells, and compare their effectiveness in capturing sequential information in text data.
